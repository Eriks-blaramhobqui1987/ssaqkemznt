Oh man, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness, and let me tell you, it was a wild ride. Like, I wasn't even sure if I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 an artsy romance or a bizarre thriller half the time. You know that feeling? The whole plot was like a long makeup tutorial that keeps you guessing each step... like woah, didn't see that contour coming! 😂

Okay, so get this, right, the main character (her name escapes me now, oops) had this massive crush-face thing going on, and I was just there, eyes glued, thinking girl, blend that out! But in a good way, you know? Because the emotions were real, just like when you're not confident if the eyeliner flick will match the other eye. Who knew? Love and eyeliner, same struggle. And the lighting in some scenes—seriously, who did their lighting? If I could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just for the lighting notes, I would.

The swings between dreamy sequences and real-life drama were like, reminded me of blending eyeshadows and hoping they end up looking like something instead of post-fallout raccoon eyes, ugh. No one told me I'd need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with emotional setting spray on hand.

> So at one point, there's this scene that totally grabbed me. It was half poetic, half dramatic mess, kinda like when your foundation oxidizes halfway through the day. I mean, we invest in products (and feelings), but... sigh, universe, amiright? Anyway, the love-serenade monologue bit! I was just, like, can we just focus on smiles that match the vibe instead of spiraling, please?

Random thought, isn't it weird how 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 these 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 makes you rethink all your life choices? Like, should I really spend an hour on winged liner just to have it melt by lunchtime? Deep stuff. 😂

int dramaticRevelation() { return 0; } // Was that even code? I dunno why I dropped that in here.

Anyway, overall, the   was... let's say, a creative take on love-timism? Y'know? Maybe I'll keep that one in my background-for-when-I'm-baking playlist, just 'cause it inspires different swirls, you know what I mean? I gotta run now, gotta try a new lip kit s𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩. Catch you later, and don’t forget to remind me to recommend more unpredictable  s for your next chill-out session! 💄🎬
